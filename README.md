### _Planning Process:_
As a developer who will be interviewing soon, I wanted to make something that consolidates what I will be doing for the upcoming weeks/months: Studying algorithms and listening to music!

### _Future Versions_:
My initial plan was to integrate the Spotify Web API, however due to time-constraits I had to pivot and display a music player that streams from links I have hosted on [cloudinary.com](https://www.cloudinary.com)

I plan to use Spotify to login and display the user's playlists by making a request to the API
